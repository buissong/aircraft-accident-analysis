# aircraft-accident-analysis

I completed a comprehensive text analysis project on 1,906 aircraft accident reports from the NTSB. The goal was to uncover patterns in accidents, especially during instructional flights. My approach combined qualitative insights and quantitative analytics, beginning with cross-tabulation of structured data to identify phases of flight with high accident rates.

The project entailed deep dives into narrative data, employing text frequency analysis to reveal prevalent terms in accident reports and generating word clouds for visual representation. I leveraged Local Filters to focus on specific subgroups like "Instructional" flights and "Landing" incidents, enhancing the depth of analysis. The results pinpointed common phrases such as "directional control" and "failure to maintain," which were frequently associated with accidents.

Advancing the analysis, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for an intricate understanding of thematic structures within the reports. The creation of term plots and document plots provided conceptual maps of term associations and document similarities, offering a more nuanced view of the accident reports.

The synthesis of this information allowed me to compile thematic groupings that elucidated underlying patterns of accident causality. The analysis revealed critical insights into instructional flight accidents, highlighting issues like aircraft submersion due to procedural discrepancies and decision-making during landing phases in challenging environments.

This project underscored the value of integrating diverse text analysis methods to generate a rich, multifaceted understanding of aviation safety data. It showcased how text analytics could be strategically applied to derive actionable insights for enhancing safety protocols and making informed, data-driven decisions for flight schools and aviation authorities.
